<a id="lineconf" class="anchor" href="#lineconf" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LineConf</h1>

<p>New York City, also known as "The City That Always Waits", is home to so many great lines.</p>

<p>We're a group of line connoiseurs who curated a day of waiting in some of NYC's best lines, paired along with talks on line-related topics like: Lines of Code, Queuing Theory, Lines of Poetry, Assembly Lines, Line Dancing, Line Art, Professional Line Waiting, and more. We invite you to explore lines with us!</p>

<p>You're not required to purchase anything at the end of the line. We encourage participants to bring snacks and water. We'll also have a few folding stools available.</p>

<p>Feel free to invite friends or come up with a topic you'd like to speak about.</p>

<a id="tentative-schedule" class="anchor" href="#tentative-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tentative Schedule</h2>

<p>Part of waiting in lines is being forced to confront uncertainty and our inability to fully control our destiny. As such, this schedule is tentative!</p>
