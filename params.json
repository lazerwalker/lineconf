  "body": "# LineConf\r\n\r\nNew York City, also known as \"The city that always waits\", is home to so many great lines. We're a group of line connoiseurs who curated a day of waiting in some of NYC's best lines, paired along with talks on line-related topics like: Lines of Code, Queuing Theory, Lines of Poetry, Assembly Lines, Line Dancing, Line Art, Professional Line Waiting, and more. We invite you to explore lines with us! You're not required to purchase anything at the end of the line. We encourage participants to bring snacks and water. We'll also have a few folding stools available.\r\n\r\nFeel free to invite friends or come up with a topic you'd like to speak about.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tentative Schedule\r\n\r\nPart of waiting in lines is being forced to confront uncertainty and impotence.
